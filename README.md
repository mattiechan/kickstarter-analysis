# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  To help guide Louise in launching a successful crowdfunding campaign with a goal of more than $10,000 for her play “Fever”, based on previously successfully crowdfunded campaigns. 

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to identify the factors that may lead to a successful campaign. Based on these factors, Louise will be able to take into consideration what leads to a successfully funded project.  

## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  There is a trend that signifies successful campaigns based on launch date. Campaigns that were launched in the middle of the year had a high probability of being successful compared to any other time of the year with the least successful being launched towards the end of the year. 
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   The most successful campaign were with goals between $1000 and $4999. Based on Louise's goal of $10000, there is a 50% probability of her campaign being successful. Any campaigns with a goal of more than $19999 drastically decreases the probability of being successful.

## Recommendations
  Louise should launch her campaign during the months of May through July as those months are the most successful within the year timeframe. Recommend not launching a campaign towards the end of the year as those campaigns had a significantly lower probability of succeeding. Louise should lower her campaign goal of $10000 because campaigns with a higher goal had a lower probabilty of reaching their goal when compared to those with a lower campaign goal. 

### Limitations 
  There are many limitations of this dataset that doesn’t allow us to give Louise a more relevant and more informed analysis to emulate a successful campaign. As a newcomer to the world of theatre, how does she compare to others that are using crowdfunding for their plays? The data used in this analysis is from a few years ago and doesn’t portray the current crowdfunding landscape. What was the outreach of other campaigns? That information was not provided and can be a factor whether or not a campaign can be successful or not. What genre are these other campaigns categorized as? These are only a few outstanding factors that were not included in the data set that can greatly effect the outcome of a campaign.
